<h1>Online Shopping System</h1>
<p>
   This system is an online shopping platform that allows users to browse and purchase products using a command-line interface.<br>
   The system is written in C language, using C17 standard, and utilizes CSV files to store and retrieve information about products and user accounts.<br>
   The code was developed using CLion IDE. This project was built as an opportunity to experiment with the C language and improve my skills as a developer.

   The appropriate needed CSV files for access to the information about products and user accounts will create automatically within folder "Data".
